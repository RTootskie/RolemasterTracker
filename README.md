# RolemasterTracker
Tracker to allow Rolemaster GMs to track combat and retrospectively look back to rounds.

# Idea Summary
GM is able to create profiles for players and monsters and then load them up in the combat tracker to allow for easier tracking for bleed, stun, hits, power points and etc. They are able to save the general state of the command in the click of a button and load it back up.

Does not communicate with the internet, everything saved locally. (Initially)

# Idea Gratitude
S. H. gave me the idea with initial conceptionalization and general logic of application.
